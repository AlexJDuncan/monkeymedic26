<h2>Hiya Folks!!</h2>

<p>My Name is Alex Duncan. I am a full stack engineer that takes pride in everything I do.  That includes getting stuck in my code.  Getting stuck gives me the opportuniity learn even more and expand my knowledge of the particular problem area. My passion, as of now, is connected to my Graphic Design background.  I love bringing my projects to life on the client facing side. </p>
